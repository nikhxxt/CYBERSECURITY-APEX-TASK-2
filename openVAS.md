# üîê Metasploitable2 Vulnerability Scan ‚Äì OpenVAS Report

**Date:** October 07, 2025  
**Analyst:** Malki Shaik Nikhat Naaz  
**Internship Track:** Task 2 ‚Äì Network Security & Scanning  
**Purpose:**  
To conduct a full vulnerability assessment of the Metasploitable2 VM, identify exploitable services and misconfigurations, and propose remediation strategies.

---

## üß™ Scan Overview

An in-depth scan was performed using OpenVAS, targeting all active ports and services on the Metasploitable2 virtual machine. The scan revealed a range of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, mostly due to outdated software and insecure protocols.

---

## üö® Critical Findings

These vulnerabilities pose immediate threats and could lead to full system compromise:

- **vsftpd 2.3.4 ‚Äì Root Access via Backdoor**  
  This FTP daemon contains a known backdoor that allows unauthenticated users to gain root privileges.

- **UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 ‚Äì Remote Command Execution**  
  A hidden backdoor in this IRC service enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely.

- **Apache Tomcat/Coyote Jserv ‚Äì Buffer Overflow Risk**  
  A flaw in the Jserv protocol could be exploited to inject and run malicious code.

üìå **Remediation:**  
Upgrade all vulnerable services to patched versions to eliminate these critical risks.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High-Risk Vulnerabilities

Additional services were flagged for serious security flaws:

- **MySQL 5.0.51a**  
  This legacy database version is vulnerable to privilege escalation and other known exploits.

- **Apache HTTP Server 2.2.8**  
  The web server has multiple documented flaws that could expose sensitive data.

- **Telnet (Port 23)**  
  Telnet transmits credentials in plaintext, making it highly vulnerable to interception.

- **Samba (NetBIOS/SMB)**  
  A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Samba service could allow remote code execution with elevated privileges.

üìå **Remediation:**  
Update all legacy services and disable insecure protocols like Telnet to reduce exposure.

## üß† Analyst Reflection & Recommendations

Metasploitable2 is designed to be vulnerable, but this scan illustrates how similar configurations in real-world systems could be exploited. The presence of backdoors, buffer overflows, and plaintext protocols provides multiple entry points for attackers.

### ‚úÖ Action Plan:

- Apply patches to all outdated services  
- Remove or disable unnecessary and insecure protocols  
- Configure firewall rules to block unauthorized access  
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies and suspicious behavior
