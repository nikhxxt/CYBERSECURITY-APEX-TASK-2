## 🎯 Objectives

This task focuses on foundational cybersecurity techniques used in penetration testing and network defense:

- 🔍 Perform passive and active reconnaissance
- 📡 Conduct TCP/UDP scans using Nmap
- 🧠 Detect operating system and service versions
- 🔒 Configure iptables firewall with dynamic port scan detection
- 🧪 Analyze vulnerabilities using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials
- 📊 Capture and inspect HTTP, DNS, and FTP traffic using Wireshark
